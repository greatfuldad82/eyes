
eye movement exercise 
  
 ** description**
    
    we set the eyes as html elements under the 'eyes' div amd are thus able to get a handle on each individul 'ball' within our jS. 
    
    they are set equally which will later allow them to be manipulated the exact same by our javascript event handler es6 arrow function 'onmousemove'
    
    we then loop through x and y variables to complete the dom manipulation.  this is a great exercise that utilizes the dom and the three languages, showing
    us how effective they can be, especially when employing for loops and event handlers in javascript.
    
 **instructions:**
    
    save files .css .html locally on your machine.  open google chrome and simply drag and drop the html element into your google console.  
    
    the animation will then appear and you will see the eyes following your mouse movements. 
    
** coming**

  i hope to use this same approach in future repos, specifically to animate web pages but also to build applications utilizing the full manipulation offered   by these very powerful javascript expressions and loops.
